\par *******This file should be named narbq11.txt or narbq11.zip******
\par 
\par Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, narbq12.txt
\par 
\par We are now trying to release all our etexts one year in advance
\par of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
\par Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
\par even years after the official publication date.
\par 
\par Please note neither this listing nor its contents are final til
\par midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
\par The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
\par Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
\par preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
\par and editing by those who wish to do so.
\par 
\par Most people start at our sites at:
\par [3]http://gutenberg.net or
\par [4]http://promo.net/pg
\par 
\par These Web sites include award-winning information about Project
\par Gutenberg, including how to donate, how to help produce our new
\par etexts, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter (free!).
\par 
\par 
\par Those of you who want to download any Etext before announcement
\par can get to them as follows, and just download by date.  This is
\par also a good way to get them instantly upon announcement, as the
\par indexes our cataloguers produce obviously take a while after an
\par announcement goes out in the Project Gutenberg Newsletter.
\par

\par Just search by the first five letters of the filename you want,
\par as it appears in our Newsletters.
\par 
\par 
\par Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)
\par 
\par We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
\par time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
\par to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
\par searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
\par projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
\par per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
\par million dollars per hour in 2001 as we release over 50 new Etext
\par files per month, or 500 more Etexts in 2000 for a total of 4000+
\par If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
\par should reach over 300 billion Etexts given away by year's end.
\par 
\par The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
\par Files by December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000 = 1 Trillion]
\par This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
\par which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
\par 
\par At our revised rates of production, we will reach only one-third
\par of that goal by the end of 2001, or about 4,000 Etexts.  We need
\par funding, as well as continued efforts by volunteers, to maintain
\par or increase our production and reach our goals.
\par 
\par The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation has been created
\par to secure a future for Project Gutenberg into the next millennium.
\par

I want love and I daresay the entire human race does too. But love comes to you, and it will, maybe in the form you least expect. But it cannot be chased after and brought down with a left and a right like a bird. You cannot capture love, by its very natu

ced that, and look where it got us. Love, for me at any rate, is the person who is always there for you, and you for them, even when you are tired, down, fatigued from work, maybe not looking your best, in bed with 'flu and looking a freak. Love is, wheth
